abstract: >
  Studies of the adult mouse brain have benefited from three-dimensional atlases providing a standard frame of reference for data analysis and integration. Extending these resources to the developing mouse brain has been challenging due to the need to integrate time as a dimension of the atlas. To address this, we present the Developmental Mouse Brain Atlas, a four-dimensional atlas encompassing each postnatal day from 4 to 56.
